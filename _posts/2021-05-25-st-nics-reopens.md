Good News! Our climbing wall at St Nick’s will re-open from this Tuesday 25 May.

### **Regular club evenings resume on Tuesdays 7:15 - 10pm**

As most of you will know, the wall was closed after the arson attack last year and has remained closed ever since because of the pandemic. Now that the sports centre is open, we have been able to get their agreement to run the wall sessions again.

*Note the new day* because of Covid a lot of classes have been moved into the main hall for the extra ventilation and Tuesday evening was the only available slot. The time is slightly different too, the wall will be open from 7:15pm (instead of 7pm) until 10pm.

As it has been so long, I will just remind everyone that only club members (or guests/minors they are responsible for) may climb. This is for insurance reasons. On the other hand, there is nothing to stop anyone joining on the night.

The usual Covid precautions apply: facemasks need to worn unless actually climbing, hand sanitiser will be provided, and it goes without saying that if you or anyone in your household has symptoms or a positive test, then please don’t come along.

In addition, there is now a limit of 16 people allowed to be there at any time. This is another Covid measure, not a permanent change.

Finally, and inevitably, the price has gone up to £4 (from £3.60). This is the money charged by the sports centre, the club does not receive any of this.


We are really looking forward to seeing everyone again.
