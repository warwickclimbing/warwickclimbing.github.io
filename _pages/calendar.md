## COVID-19 STATEMENT

The Warwick Climbing Club committee has decided to resume organising Trips and some Socials for 2021 where possible and where both national and local rules allow. This policy will be reviwed every few months.

- Most indoor climbing walls are open in some capacity, please check individual centre rules.
- You should try not to share a vehicle with those outside your household or support bubble.

The BMC published their advice (see below) the main points of which being:
- Maintain social distancing with your climbing partner and group.
- Sanitise your hands regularly.
- Where possible use your own kit, climbing equipment and consumables (maps, guidebooks, lunch, drinks etc)
- Avoid touching gates and path furniture where possible. Be considerate on paths and trails to maintain social distancing.
