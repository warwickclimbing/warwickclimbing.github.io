## COVID-19 STATEMENT
The club is currently not organising any events, socials or regular trips due to the restrictions in place. Additionally, the club is unable to climb at St. Nicolas park leisure centre due to ongoing repairs at the centre and the wall has not yet reopened. Although the club is always open to new members, membership runs the calendar year and therefore please keep checking the website for updates in the new year when we will be able to provide more information as to club activities.

## Membership
The annual membership subscription is currently set to Â£20.00. For that club members get discounted entry to the climbing wall at St Nicholas Park (in Warwick), discounts at local outdoor shops and club affiliated membership of the BMC ... as well as organised climbing trips throughout the year and the benefit of our combined wisdom!

Application forms are available from the Membership Secretary or from any Club Official at the wall. Please contact us via [email](mailto:membership@warwickclimbingclub.co.uk).
