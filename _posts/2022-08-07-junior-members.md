### The committee has approved the inclusion of junior members!
*Juniors will be accepted from the 1 August 2022.*

# Junior Memberships
First, a bit of background. Some years ago, the BMC (like most similar organisations) introduced strict regulations for all affiliated clubs who accepted juniors and the clubs responded to that by stopping accepting junior members. Juniors in this context being defined as those under 18 years old.

It is still the case that if the club accepts juniors and takes full responsibility for them, then we would need a Child Protection Officer and a thick tome of laws and regulations kick in.

However, the BMC now make an exception for the case when the junior remains the responsibility of a specific adult member (a parent or guardian). 
That parent or guardian then may pass responsibility to another adult to act in their place. Under this model (called the Family Model) a member may bring along a junior to a meet or any club event, provided that the adult member retains responsibility at all times.
The club is never in loco parentis and therefore the full weight of the regulations does not fall on us. Obviously, we would still have a duty of care, as we do for any member.

## Joining
To join up, a junior will need the form filled in and their details submitted to the BMC. Once this is done, they become a BMC club member, and are entitled to the same benefits as any other member.
This includes the liability insurance, which means that they are covered to use the St Nicolas Park climbing wall, as long as their parent/guardian accompanies them.

## Subscriptions
The Committee has decided to take juniors “at cost” ie we will take only what the BMC charges us.
- The good news is that for under-11’s, that means membership is FREE.
- For 11-17 year olds, the subscription is £15.50 (£10.50 for half a year).

## St Nicolas Park Wall
The charge for using the wall is based on the fact that the junior member is the responsibility of the adult member (parent/guardian).
- Under-11’s : FREE
- 11–17 years old: £3.00 per session (£2.50 if bought as a pack of five).
